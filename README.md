# SlayThe
Card Game with minimax AI opponent implementation

All the code is located in Assets>>Scripts

Majority of AI contained in Assets>>Scripts>>EnemyScript.cs (This contains the minimax algorithm and decision making)

This is used in conjunction with Assets>>Scripts>>LogicScript.cs to control the flow of the game

P.S. there are some left over functions from when I had different ideas for the game during original planning
