# SlayThe
Card Game with minimax AI opponent implementation

Majority of AI contained in Assets>>Scripts>>EnemyScript.cs

This is used in conjunction with Assets>>Scripts>>LogicScript.cs to control the flow of the game

P.S. there are some left over functions from when I had different ideas for the game during original planning
